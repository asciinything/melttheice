A self-hosted, open-source application for sharing real-time, location-based information to empower and protect communities.

## üìñ Mission & Guiding Principles

The mission of **Community Alert** is to empower communities by sharing real-time, location-based information about immigration-enforcement activity so individuals can make informed safety decisions.

Our development is guided by these core, non-negotiable principles:

*   üîí **User Anonymity & Privacy-by-Design:** We collect the absolute minimum data required. We never use traditional accounts, and all sensitive data (like location) is encrypted at rest and automatically deleted after 24 hours.
*   ü§ù **Open Source & Community Collaboration:** All core code is MIT licensed. We believe in transparent governance and building a broad, inclusive contributor base.
*   ·à´ **Operational Independence:** We self-host our infrastructure to ensure predictable costs, avoid vendor lock-in, and maintain full control over user data.
*   ‚öñÔ∏è **Legal & Ethical Compliance:** We are committed to responsible operation, with clear moderation policies to prevent abuse and a commitment to transparency.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **Anonymous Reporting:** Users can anonymously report a sighting at a specific location without creating an account.
*   **Community Confirmation:** A Waze-like voting system allows other users to confirm or deny a report, building a `credibility_score`.
*   **Proximity-Based Alerts:** Once a report reaches a credibility threshold, anonymous push notifications are sent to users within a defined radius.
*   **Automatic Data Expiration:** To protect privacy, all report and location data is permanently deleted from the database after 24 hours.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
